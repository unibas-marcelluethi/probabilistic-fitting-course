# Introduction - Analysis by Synthesis 


From the [previous online course](https://gravis.dmi.unibas.ch/PMM/lectures/ssm_courseRun19/) we know that a shape model is essentially a probability distribution over shapes. Sampling from this distribution correspond to representative shapes from the shape family that we modelled. That we can generate (or synthesize) shapes from the model plays an important role in our fitting approach.  We follow a paradigm that is called *analysis by synthesis*.  The main idea behind analysis by synthesis can be paraphrased as follows:

> If we manage to synthesize given data using our model, we are likely to have a good understanding of the data in terms of our model. 

In a nutshell, analysis by synthesis works by generating samples from the model, which are then compared to 
the data that we want to explain. The model parameters that lead to such good samples, will serve as our explanation of the data in terms of the model. Once we know the parameters of our model that lead to good representation of the data, we can use the model to explain the data, fill in missing parts, and, more generally, reason about the data. 

In the next video we will describe the architecture of an analysis-by-synthesis application in more detail. We will then discuss the mathematical framework, namely Bayesian inference, which we will use to formalize the approach. 

#### Steps
1. Analysis-by-synthesis ([Video](tobedone), [Slides](tobedone))
2. Bayesian probabiliy ([Video](tobedone), [Slides)](tobedone))
3. Shape model fitting as Bayesian linear regression ([Article](linearregression))
4. Prior and posterior predictive checks ([Tutorial](prior-and-posterior-predictive-checks))
